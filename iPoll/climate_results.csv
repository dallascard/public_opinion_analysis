Methodology: Conducted by GfK Knowledge Networks, October 17 - October 28, 2014 and based on   1,275 online interviews. Sample: National adult. The poll was fielded by GfK Knowledge Networks using its national KnowledgePanel.  The KnowledgePanel is a nationally representative probability sample of the U.S. adult population. Panelists are recruited by randomly selecting residential addresses using a process called address-based sampling (ABS). Since nearly 3-in-10 U.S. households do not have home Internet access, respondent households who do not have Internet access or own a computer are provided Internet service and a netbook computer to ensure that panel respondents are representative of the U.S. adult population. Unlike opt-in panels, households are not permitted to ""self-select"" into KnowledgePanel; nor are they allowed to participate in many surveys per week. Funding was provided by the 11th Hour Project, the Energy Foundation, the Grantham Foundation, and the V.K. Rasmussen Foundation. [USKN.111814CC.R04] (View Citation)

Interviews were conducted both online using a self-administered design and by telephone using live interviewers. All interviews were conducted among participants in AmeriSpeak, a probability-based panel designed to be representative of the national US adult population run by NORC at the University of Chicago. Panel participants without Internet access were interviewed via telephone by professional interviewers under the direction of NORC. NORC's AmeriSpeak Panel provides a representative panel of civilian, non-institutional adults (age 18 and over) living in the United States.
45% of completed interviews are sourced from Amerispeak, and 55% of completed interviews are sourced from a panel of young adults custom built by NORC. The Young Adult sample is from a probability-based household panel that uses an address based sample from a registered voter database of the entire US. Households were selected using stratified random sampling to support over-sampling of households with African Americans, Hispanics, and Asians ages 18-30.

Survey by Associated Press.
Methodology: Conducted by AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, October 15 - October 18, 2015 and based on   1,058 telephone and online interviews. Sample: National adult. 753 respondents were interviewed online, and 305 by telephone.
Interviews were conducted both online using a self-administered design and by telephone using live interviewers. All interviews were conducted among participants in AmeriSpeak, a probability-based panel designed to be representative of the national US adult population run by NORC at the University of Chicago. Panel participants without Internet access were interviewed via telephone by professional interviewers under the direction of NORC. NORC?s AmeriSpeak Panel provides a representative panel of civilian, non-institutional adults (age 18 and over) living in the United States. [USAP.111715N.R10] (View Citation)

All interviews were conducted among participants in AmeriSpeak, a probability-based panel designed to be representative of the national US adult population run by NORC at the University of Chicago. Panel participants without Internet access were interviewed via telephone by professional interviewers under the direction of NORC. NORC's AmeriSpeak Panel provides a representative panel of civilian, non-institutional adults (age 18 and over) living in the United States.
45% of completed interviews are sourced from Amerispeak, and 55% of completed interviews are sourced from a panel of young adults custom built by NORC. The Young Adult sample is from a probability-based household panel that uses an address based sample from a registered voter database of the entire US. Households were selected using stratified random sampling to support over-sampling of households with African Americans, Hispanics, and Asians ages 18-30. NORC contacted sampled households by US mail and by telephone, inviting them to register and participate in public opinion surveys twice a month [USAP.120616N.R10A] (View Citation)

The poll was fielded by GfK Knowledge Networks using its national KnowledgePanel.  The KnowledgePanel is a nationally representative probability sample of the U.S. adult population. Panelists are recruited by randomly selecting residential addresses using a process called address-based sampling (ABS). Since nearly 3-in-10 US households do not have home Internet access, respondent households who do not have Internet access or own a computer are provided Internet service and a netbook computer to ensure that panel respondents are representative of the US adult population. Unlike opt-in panels, households are not permitted to 'self-select' into KnowledgePanel; nor are they allowed to participate in many surveys per week. Funding was provided by the 11th Hour Project, the Energy Foundation, the Grantham Foundation, and the MacArthur Foundation. [USKN.050416CC.R02] (View Citation)

Methodology: Conducted by AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, September 15 - September 18, 2016 and based on   1,022 telephone and online interviews. Sample: National adult. 821 respondents were interviewed online, and 201 by telephone.
Interviews were conducted both online using a self-administered design and by telephone using live interviewers. All interviews were conducted among participants in AmeriSpeak, a probability-based panel designed to be representative of the national US adult population run by NORC at the University of Chicago. Panel participants without Internet access were interviewed via telephone by professional interviewers under the direction of NORC. NORCs AmeriSpeak Panel provides a representative panel of civilian, non-institutional adults (age 18 and over) living in the United States. [USAP.092416N.R07P] (View Citation)

Now is the time for us to be using new forms of energy that are made in America and will be renewable forever. We can manufacture better cars that use less gasoline and build better appliances that use less electricity. We need to transform the outdated ways of generating energy into new ones that create jobs and entire industries, and stop the damage we've been doing to the environment.'

They say we need to let the free market and the public's preferences determine which energy sources succeed by reducing regulations on the development of traditional energy resources and ending government subsidies for alternative energy ventures that often fail. Opponents say the Republican approach is not a balanced one because it will harm the environment and increase American dependence on non-renewable and dirty energy sources. The Republican plan calls for more drilling in American oceans, national forests, and public lands, reducing protections against air and water pollution, and will increase carbon pollution that scientists say is responsible for climate change.

First statement: When it comes to energy and gas prices.  Barack Obama says foreign oil imports are costing our economy 1.4 billion dollars a day.  The recent increase in gas prices makes it plain that we cannot be held hostage by oil companies any longer.  He will invest $150 billion in clean, renewable energy, including bio-fuels to end the oil monopoly, and increase fuel standards further for American cars and trucks.  He strongly opposes lifting the limit on off-shore oil drilling saying it will do little to reduce the price of gas and is not worth the environmental cost.  Second statement:  John McCain says we need to invest more in alternative fuels and conserve more.  This is not only good for the country, but for the environment, and he led the effort in the US (United States)Senate for a comprehensive plan to reduce global warming.  But he also says that we need more domestic production of oil and has proposed lifting the federal ban on off-shore oil drilling to help reduce our dependence on foreign oil and stop sending money to countries friendly to terrorists.
