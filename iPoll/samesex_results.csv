Methodology: Conducted by Public Religion Research Institute, August 23 - September 3, 2013 and based on   1,563 online interviews. Sample: National adult Hispanics. Funding was provided by the Ford Foundation and the New World Foundation. The poll was fielded by GfK Knowledge Networks using its national KnowledgePanel.  The KnowledgePanel is a nationally representative probability sample of the U.S. adult population. Panelists are recruited by randomly selecting residential addresses using a process called address-based sampling (ABS). Since nearly 3-in-10 U.S. households do not have home Internet access, respondent households who do not have Internet access or own a computer are provided Internet service and a netbook computer to ensure that panel respondents are representative of the U.S. adult population. Unlike opt-in panels, households are not permitted to self-select into KnowledgePanel; nor are they allowed to participate in many surveys per week. [USPRRI.092713H.R12A] (View Citation)

Methodology: Conducted by Princeton Survey Research Associates International, June 28 - July 9, 2012 and based on   2,973 telephone interviews. Sample: National adult. 1771 respondents were interviewed on a landline telephone, and 1202 were interviewed on a cell phone, including 596 who had no landline telephone.  The questions in this report were developed in consultation with Religion and Ethics NewsWeekly.  In partnership with Religion and Ethics NewsWeekly the Pew Forum conducted an additional 511 interviews with religiously unaffiliated adults to produce a total sample of 958 unaffiliated respondents.  The additional 511 interviews were conducted June 28-July 10, 2012 with religiously unaffiliated adults recruited by screening respondents from a fresh sample of landline and cell phone (261 interviews), and by recontacting respondents from recent surveys who had identified themselves as religiously unaffiliated (250 interviews).

Survey by PRRI.
Methodology: Conducted by Public Religion Research Institute, February 12 - February 25, 2015 and based on   2,314 online interviews. Sample: National adults age 18-35 including oversamples of African-Americans, Hispanics, and Asian-Pacific Islanders. Results were weighted to be representative of a national adult sample.  Funding was provided by the Ford Foundation. The poll was fielded by GfK Knowledge Networks using its national KnowledgePanel.  The KnowledgePanel is a nationally representative probability sample of the U.S. adult population. Panelists are recruited by randomly selecting residential addresses using a process called address-based sampling (ABS). Since nearly 3-in-10 U.S. households do not have home Internet access, respondent households who do not have Internet access or own a computer are provided Internet service and a netbook computer to ensure that panel respondents are representative of the U.S. adult population. Unlike opt-in panels, households are not permitted to ""self-select"" into KnowledgePanel; nor are they allowed to participate in many surveys per week. [USPRRI.032715.R04A] (View Citation)

Methodology: Conducted by GfK Knowledge Networks, September 25 - September 29, 2014 and based on   1,845 online interviews. Sample: National adult. The poll was fielded by GfK Knowledge Networks using its national KnowledgePanel.  The KnowledgePanel is a nationally representative probability sample of the U.S. adult population. Panelists are recruited by randomly selecting residential addresses using a process called address-based sampling (ABS). Since nearly 3-in-10 U.S. households do not have home Internet access, respondent households who do not have Internet access or own a computer are provided Internet service and a netbook computer to ensure that panel respondents are representative of the U.S. adult population. Unlike opt-in panels, households are not permitted to ""self-select"" into KnowledgePanel; nor are they allowed to participate in many surveys per week. [USAP.100114G.R11H] (View Citation)

The poll was fielded by GfK Knowledge Networks using its national KnowledgePanel. The KnowledgePanel is a nationally representative probability sample of the U.S. adult population. Panelists are recruited by randomly selecting residential addresses using a process called address-based sampling (ABS). Since nearly 3-in-10 U.S. households do not have home Internet access, respondent households who do not have Internet access or own a computer are provided Internet service and a netbook computer to ensure that panel respondents are representative of the U.S. adult population. Unlike opt-in panels, households are not permitted to ""self-select"" into KnowledgePanel; nor are they allowed to participate in many surveys per week. [USAP.103014G.R11] (View Citation)

The poll was fielded by GfK Knowledge Networks using its national KnowledgePanel.  The KnowledgePanel is a nationally representative probability sample of the U.S. adult population. Panelists are recruited by randomly selecting residential addresses using a process called address-based sampling (ABS). Since nearly 3-in-10 U.S. households do not have home Internet access, respondent households who do not have Internet access or own a computer are provided Internet service and a netbook computer to ensure that panel respondents are representative of the U.S. adult population. Unlike opt-in panels, households are not permitted to ""self-select"" into KnowledgePanel; nor are they allowed to participate in many surveys per week. [USAP.042915G.R06] (View Citation)

Survey by PRRI.
Methodology: Conducted by Public Religion Research Institute, February 12 - February 25, 2015 and based on   2,314 online interviews. Sample: National adults age 18-35 including oversamples of African-Americans, Hispanics, and Asian-Pacific Islanders. Results were weighted to be representative of a national adult sample.  Funding was provided by the Ford Foundation. The poll was fielded by GfK Knowledge Networks using its national KnowledgePanel.  The KnowledgePanel is a nationally representative probability sample of the U.S. adult population. Panelists are recruited by randomly selecting residential addresses using a process called address-based sampling (ABS). Since nearly 3-in-10 U.S. households do not have home Internet access, respondent households who do not have Internet access or own a computer are provided Internet service and a netbook computer to ensure that panel respondents are representative of the U.S. adult population. Unlike opt-in panels, households are not permitted to ""self-select"" into KnowledgePanel; nor are they allowed to participate in many surveys per week. [USPRRI.032715.R03A] (View Citation)

Survey by Pew Research Center for the People & the Press, Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life.
Methodology: Conducted by Princeton Survey Research Associates International, June 28 - July 9, 2012 and based on   2,973 telephone interviews. Sample: National adult. 1771 respondents were interviewed on a landline telephone, and 1202 were interviewed on a cell phone, including 596 who had no landline telephone.  The questions in this report were developed in consultation with Religion and Ethics NewsWeekly.  In partnership with Religion and Ethics NewsWeekly the Pew Forum conducted an additional 511 interviews with religiously unaffiliated adults to produce a total sample of 958 unaffiliated respondents.  The additional 511 interviews were conducted June 28-July 10, 2012 with religiously unaffiliated adults recruited by screening respondents from a fresh sample of landline and cell phone (261 interviews), and by recontacting respondents from recent surveys who had identified themselves as religiously unaffiliated (250 interviews).  These interviews are not used in the results reported for the general public here. [USPSRA.071212.R13] (View Citation)

The poll was fielded by GfK Knowledge Networks using its national KnowledgePanel.  The KnowledgePanel is a nationally representative probability sample of the US adult population. Panelists are recruited by randomly selecting residential addresses using a process called address-based sampling (ABS). Since nearly 3-in-10 US households do not have home Internet access, respondent households who do not have Internet access or own a computer are provided Internet service and a netbook computer to ensure that panel respondents are representative of the US adult population. Unlike opt-in panels, households are not permitted to ""self-select"" into KnowledgePanel; nor are they allowed to participate in many surveys per week. [USKN.121015IOP.R054] (View Citation)

Panelists are recruited by randomly selecting residential addresses using a process called address-based sampling (ABS). Since nearly 3-in-10 U.S. households do not have home Internet access, respondent households who do not have Internet access or own a computer are provided Internet service and a netbook computer to ensure that panel respondents are representative of the U.S. adult population. Unlike opt-in panels, households are not permitted to ""self-select"" into KnowledgePanel; nor are they allowed to participate in many surveys per week. [USAP.071815G.R03] (View Citation)

The poll was fielded by GfK Knowledge Networks using its national KnowledgePanel.  The KnowledgePanel is a nationally representative probability sample of the U.S. adult population. Panelists are recruited by randomly selecting residential addresses using a process called address-based sampling (ABS). Since nearly 3-in-10 U.S. households do not have home Internet access, respondent households who do not have Internet access or own a computer are provided Internet service and a netbook computer to ensure that panel respondents are representative of the U.S. adult population. Unlike opt-in panels, households are not permitted to ""self-select"" into KnowledgePanel; nor are they allowed to participate in many surveys per week. [USAP.122613G.R10F] (View Citation)

The Democratic candidate says, I believe we need to be fair and support granting civil unions to gay and lesbian couples, which grant many of the legal rights and responsibilities of married couples.  But I oppose a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage because decisions about marriage should be left to the states as they always have been.  This debate is important, but the Republican candidate for Congress is using it to divide our country and distract our attention from their lack of solutions to end the war in Iraq and fix our struggling economy.  The Republican candidate says, the recent decision by the California Supreme Court to legalize gay marriage is a big step that can lead to force other states to accept marriage between gay and lesbian couples.  We need a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage and preserve the sanctity of marriage between a man and a woman.

After hearing the statements, regardless of how you plan to vote, please tell me which statement you agree with more.  The Republican says, our country faces many threats, but few threaten us as much as the breakdown of the family unit and the liberal effort to overturn laws defining marriage as the union of a man and a woman.  In Congress, I will fight to lower taxes and decrease government regulation so that individual Americans can prosper, but I will never forget that we cannot prosper if we sacrifice our moral foundation.  The Democrat says, politicians like to focus on issues that divide us, like gay marriage, but I say 'who cares?' I don?t want the government in Washington telling two consenting adults whether they can marry anymore than I want it telling people whether they can own a gun or how they should worship.  Gay marriage is not my priority.  My priorities are reducing health care costs, decreasing our dependence on foreign oil, and creating jobs here at home.

After each statement tell whether this would make you much more likely, somewhat more likely, a little more likely, no more likely, or less likely to support George Bush in this year's (2004 Presidential)election.)...Bush says, America is a great country because of our commitment to family and our strong faith.  I have fought to restore honor and dignity to the White House and to provide steady leadership during these times of change.  But John Kerry wants to take our country in a different direction and turns his back on our traditional values.  Kerry's support for abortion has put him in conflict with the Catholic church, and he refuses to stand up for the sanctity of the American family as his state becomes the first in the nation to legalize gay marriage.  His values reflect the wrong priorities for this country....Would this make you much more likely, somewhat more likely, a little more likely, no more likely, or less likely to support George W.

Bush and John Kerry? George W. Bush says he believes marriage is the union of one man and one woman. We should continue to recognize heterosexual marriage as ensuring, promoting, and supporting a tested social structure for the bearing and raising of children. Bush says we must remember though the same moral tradition that defines marriage also teaches us that each individual has dignity and value in God's sight. While Bush says different states should have the freedom to allow civil unions, because judges in states like Massachusetts insist on legalizing gay marriage, the courts have left no choice and Bush therefore supports an amendment to the Constitution that defends the sanctity of marriage. John Kerry says he is opposed to gay marriage. We should maintain marriage as a union of a man and a woman, but we do need a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriages where the federal government dictates what people must do. Our states have always handled the question of marriage. Kerry says he personally hopes states bar gay marriage but allow civil unions, where partners can at least be allowed the same health care benefits, visitation rights and inheritance. Kerry says, it is sad that the president, apparently for political reasons, is promoting this amendment, instead of addressing the problem of jobs and health care.

The Republicans are attacking my values and questioning my patriotism, but I served my country proudly in Vietnam and value the veterans who rally to me now. Apparently, President Bush wants an election about gay marriage, and I'm opposed to that. I believe in tolerance and diversity. But I challenge the irresponsibility and values of those at the top who run up huge deficits and pass on the bills to our children. I challenge CEO's (Chief Executive Officers)who get big tax breaks and defense contracts, while shipping U.S. (United States)jobs overseas.

The Republicans are attacking my values and questioning my patriotism, but I served my country proudly in Vietnam and value the veterans who rally to me now. Apparently, President Bush wants an election about gay marriage, and I'm opposed to that. I believe in tolerance and diversity. But we need big change in America, so ordinary citizens, not corporations, get heard in Washington. We need to create jobs and get health care costs under control. Rather than more tax cuts for the very richest and exploding deficits, we need improved education and a secure retirement. So, I welcome an election about how we best take care of America.
