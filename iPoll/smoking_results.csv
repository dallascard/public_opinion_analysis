Harris Interactive, April 11 - April 18, 2011 and based on   1,987 telephone and online interviews. Sample: National adult. 1010 respondents were interviewed by telephone and 977 were interviewed online. The interviews conducted by telephone included a nationwide cross section of adults with landlines in their households.  The interviews conducted online included a nationwide sample who have agreed to take part in Harris Interactive surveys and who indicated not having a landline (i.e., cell phone only), or using their cell phone for almost all of their calls (cell phone mostly), and thus were included to ensure representation of these groups that are lacking among a traditional RDD sample.  Telephone data only were adjusted to ensure appropriate representation on number of telephone/voice lines and number of adults in the household, and online data only were adjusted by propensity to be online to correct for attitudinal/behavioral differences between our panel and those who respond by phone.  Finally, for the combined telephone and online data, figures for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, region, household income, and phone status (cell phone only, cell phone mostly, dual users, landline mostly, landline only) were adjusted as necessary to bring them in line with their actual proportions in the population.  Population proportions for demographic variables were acquired from the 2010 Current Population Survey, while phone status proportions were acquired from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS).

Panelists are recruited by randomly selecting residential addresses using a process called address-based sampling (ABS). Since nearly 3-in-10 U.S. households do not have home Internet access, respondent households who do not have Internet access or own a computer are provided Internet service and a netbook computer to ensure that panel respondents are representative of the U.S. adult population. Unlike opt-in panels, households are not permitted to ""self-select"" into KnowledgePanel; nor are they allowed to participate in many surveys per week. [USAP.042114G.R01A] (View Citation)

Currently, the FDA can regulate a box of macaroni and cheese, but not a pack of cigarettes.  This bill will provide additional resources for the scientists and health professionals at the FDA to effectively regulate tobacco products without taking away from its other responsibilities.  Statement B:  We should not give the Food and Drug Administration the authority to regulate tobacco products because the FDA already has its hands full trying to regulate prescription drugs and other products.  Regulating tobacco would take time and resources away from the FDA's main job of approving potentially life saving medications.
